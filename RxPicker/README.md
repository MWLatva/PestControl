# Rx-4Less

## Problem & Solution
This project was a part of the 2024 LehighHacks Hack for Health Hackathon, sponsored by Google Cloud & Lehigh University. Our solution, Rx-4Less, aims to address the critical issue of accessing affordable prescriptions, a challenge that lacks widespread commercial solutions. It provides a streamlined platform for users to find and compare prescription prices easily. This innovative approach fills a significant gap in healthcare, offering the most cost-saving options for medications.

## Social Impact
Rx-4-Less aims to significantly improve healthcare affordability by enabling users to easily find cost-saving prescription options, addressing a crucial gap in the current healthcare system. With further development, it has the potential to broaden its impact, making the cheapest medications accessible to a larger population and contributing positively to global health outcomes.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
